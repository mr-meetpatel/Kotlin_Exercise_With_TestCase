 * Create an abstract class Shape that defines a method getArea which takes an argument size. Create two subclasses, Square and Circle, that inherit from Shape, and implement the method.
 * Square area = size * size
 * Circle area = size * size * 3.1415
 * Create another class Geometry that takes a generic argument of type Shape, and has a method that prints a message which includes the area of the shape that is passed.
 * Instantiate the Geometry class and print the area of the shape.
