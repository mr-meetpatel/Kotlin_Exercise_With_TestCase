/**
 * You are designing a grading system for school exams. The total for an exam is 100 points, and you need to convert that into a grade A to F.
 * Design a program that reads in a number that represents a studentâ€™s grade, from 1 to 100 and prints out a grade.
 * A -> 90 to 100
 * B -> 80 to 89
 * C -> 70 to 79
 * D -> 60 to 69
 * E -> 50 to 59
 * F -> everything else
