/**
 * A bank has various rules for interest rates.
 * If a user has less than 1000 in their account, their interest rate is 1.0
 * If a user has less than 10,000 in their account, their interest rate is 0.5
 * If a user has 10000 and over, their interest rate is 0.2.
 * Implement this in a program, create an object, update the amount and print out the interest rate.
